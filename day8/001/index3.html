                    The first star (*) represents the responsiveness: sm, md, lg or xl,
                    while the second star represents a number, which should add up to 12 for each row.

    <strong>
        Chú ý là : class "col" dùng để tạo cột trong BT
        nhưng class "col" không hỗ trợ tốt responsive
        Kết luận : muốn giao diện bao nhiêu cột thì tạo bấy nhiêu
        thẻ div có class là col nằm trong thẻ row
